There is no default value for local variables, so local variables should be declared and an initial value should be assigned before the first use.



Instance variables are declared inside the body of the class.
is specific to a certain object. It is declared within the curly braces of the class but outside of any method. value of an instance variable can be changed by any method in the class, but it is not accessible from outside the class.

static variable: belongs to the class and initialized only once at the start of the execution. declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block
if you use a static keyword with a variable or a method inside a class, then for every instance that you create for that class, these static members remain constant and you can’t change or modify them

local variable: variable that's declared within the body of a method. Then you can use the variable only within that method. Local variables are declared in methods, constructors, or blocks
